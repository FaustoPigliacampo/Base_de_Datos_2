#	address
#	zip code
#	phone 
#	city
#	country
#	status (when active column is 1 show it as 'active', otherwise is 'inactive') 
#	store id

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW list_of_customers AS
	SELECT customer.customer_id, CONCAT(customer.last_name, ', ', customer.first_name) AS 'full name', address.address, 
			address.postal_code AS 'zip code', address.phone, city.city, country.country,
			CASE customer.active WHEN '1' THEN 'active'
									ELSE 'inactive'
									END AS status, 
			customer.store_id
	FROM customer
	INNER JOIN address USING (address_id)
	INNER JOIN city USING (city_id)
	INNER JOIN country USING (country_id);

SELECT * FROM list_of_customers;



#2) Create a view named film_details, it should contain the following columns:
#		film id,  title, description,  category,  price,  length,  rating, 
#		and actors - as a string of all the actors separated by comma. Hint use GROUP_CONCAT

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW film_details AS
	SELECT film.film_id, film.title, film.description, c.name AS 'category', film.replacement_cost, film.`length`, film.rating, 
			GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(actor.first_name, ' ', actor.last_name) ORDER BY actor.last_name SEPARATOR ' - ') AS 'actors'
	FROM film
	INNER JOIN film_category USING (film_id)
	INNER JOIN category c USING (category_id)
	INNER JOIN film_actor USING (film_id)
	INNER JOIN actor USING (actor_id)
	GROUP BY 1, 4;


SELECT * FROM film_details;



#3) Create view sales_by_film_category, it should return 'category' and 'total_rental' columns.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW sales_by_film_category AS
	SELECT category.name, SUM(payment.amount) AS total_rental
	FROM category 
	INNER JOIN film_category USING(category_id)
	INNER JOIN film USING(film_id)
	INNER JOIN inventory USING(film_id)
	INNER JOIN rental USING(inventory_id)
	INNER JOIN payment USING(rental_id)
	GROUP BY 1;

SELECT * FROM sales_by_film_category;



#4) Create a view called actor_information where it should return:
#		actor id, first name, last name, and the amount of films he/she acted on.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW actor_information AS
	SELECT actor.actor_id, actor.first_name, actor.last_name, COUNT(film.film_id)
	FROM actor
	INNER JOIN film_actor USING(actor_id)
	INNER JOIN film USING(film_id)
	INNER JOIN inventory USING(film_id)
	INNER JOIN rental USING(inventory_id)
	INNER JOIN payment USING(rental_id)
	GROUP BY 1;

SELECT * FROM actor_information;


#5) Analyze view actor_info, explain the entire query and specially how the sub query works.
#	Be very specific, take some time and decompose each part and give an explanation for each. 

SELECT * FROM actor_info;

Muestra el id de actor, el first_name y el last_name.
En la columna film_info muestra POR CATEGORIA, en que films de esa categoria particip√≥ el actor.
